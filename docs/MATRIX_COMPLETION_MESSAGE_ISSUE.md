# Matrix Completion Message Issue - Comprehensive Analysis

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: When OpenCode tasks complete successfully, the completion message is NOT being sent to the Matrix room that was created for the task.

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Task starts → Matrix room created ✅ (WORKING)
2. Task executes → Progress updates sent to Matrix room ✅ (WORKING)
3. Task completes → Completion message sent to Matrix room ❌ (NOT WORKING)
4. Completion notification sent to Letta agent ✅ (WORKING)

**Observed Behavior**:
- Matrix room is created successfully
- Task executes and completes successfully
- Letta agent receives completion notification
- **Matrix room NEVER receives completion message**

## Architecture Overview

### Task Execution Flow

```
1. Letta Agent → calls opencode_execute_task (MCP tool)
2. execute-task.ts → executeTask() 
   - Creates workspace block
   - Calls executeTaskAsync() (async, non-blocking)
   - Returns immediately with "queued" status
3. executeTaskAsync() → Background execution
   - Creates Matrix room
   - Calls deps.execution.execute()
   - Waits for completion
   - Should call closeTaskRoom() with completion message
   - Sends notification to Letta agent
```

### Key Files

- **src/tools/execute-task.ts**: Main task execution logic
- **src/execution-manager.ts**: Manages OpenCode server communication
- **src/opencode-client-manager.ts**: OpenCode SDK client wrapper
- **src/matrix-room-manager.ts**: Matrix room creation/messaging
- **src/server.ts**: MCP server and tool registration

## Diagnostic Journey

### Investigation 1: Logging Visibility Issue

**Problem**: Initial logs showed task starting but no completion logs
**Root Cause**: `console.log()` doesn't appear in Docker logs, only `console.error()` does
**Fix Applied**: Changed all `console.log()` to `console.error()` in execute-task.ts (commit e4d55b2)
**Result**: Now see task starting logs but still no completion logs

**Evidence**:
```

[matrix-room-manager] Created room !OjVFAposoXBmlCNLHD:matrix.oculair.ca
```

**Missing logs**:
```
[execute-task] Task completed with status: ...
[execute-task] Checking Matrix room...
[execute-task] Sending completion message to Matrix room...
[execute-task] Matrix completion message sent successfully
```

### Investigation 2: Execution Hanging Issue

**Problem**: Tasks execute but never complete - `executeTaskAsync()` hangs forever
**Root Cause**: execution-manager.ts waits for "complete" event but OpenCode server sends "finish" events
**Analysis**:
- OpenCode server logs show `type=finish part` events
- execution-manager.ts has event handler that sets `completed = true` only on "complete" event
- Event type mismatch causes infinite wait

**Code Analysis**:

execution-manager.ts (lines 95-102):
```typescript
case "complete":
  completed = true;
  break;
case "abort":
  error = error || "Task aborted";
  completed = true;
  break;
```

opencode-client-manager.ts (lines 122-132):
```typescript
for await (const event of events.stream) {
  if (event.properties?.sessionId === sessionId) {
    const openCodeEvent: OpenCodeEvent = {
      type: event.type as any,  // Passes through raw event type!
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      sessionId,
      data: event.properties,
    };
    onEvent(openCodeEvent);
  }
}
```

OpenCode server logs:
```
INFO service=session.prompt type=finish part
```

**Fix Applied**: Map "finish" events to "complete" in opencode-client-manager.ts (commit 76dfd19)
```typescript
let eventType = event.type;
if (eventType === 'finish' || eventType === 'finish-step') {
  eventType = 'complete';
}
```

### Investigation 3: Duplicate Timeout Notifications

**Problem**: Tasks that complete successfully ALSO get timeout notification ~5.5 minutes later
**Root Cause**: Timeout promise in execution-manager.ts always resolves, even when task completes
**Fix Applied**: Refactored timeout handling to properly cancel timeout when task completes (commit c06696d)

**Before**:
```typescript
const timeoutPromise = new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (!completed) {
      timedOut = true;
      // ...
    }
    resolve();  // Always resolves!
  }, timeout);
});

await Promise.race([completionPromise, timeoutPromise]);
```

**After**:
```typescript
let timeoutHandle: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;

const completionPromise = new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
  const checkInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (completed) {
      clearInterval(checkInterval);
      if (timeoutHandle) {
        clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);  // Cancel timeout
      }
      resolve();
    } else if (timedOut) {
      clearInterval(checkInterval);
      resolve();
    }
  }, 100);
  
  timeoutHandle = setTimeout(() => {
    if (!completed) {
      timedOut = true;
      clearInterval(checkInterval);
      // ...
      resolve();
    }
  }, timeout);
});

await completionPromise;
```

## Current Status

### What's Working ✅

1. **Task Creation**: Tasks are created with proper IDs and workspace blocks
2. **Matrix Room Creation**: Rooms are created successfully and admins are invited
3. **Task Execution**: OpenCode server executes tasks correctly
4. **Letta Notifications**: Completion notifications are sent to Letta agents
5. **Logging**: Debug logs now visible via console.error

### What's NOT Working ❌

1. **Matrix Completion Messages**: The completion message never reaches the Matrix room
2. **executeTaskAsync Completion**: The async function appears to hang after execution starts

### Latest Test Results

**Test**: task-1761371679485-qjm5g7umd
**Outcome**: Task completed successfully (confirmed by Letta agent message)
**Evidence**: 
- Letta received: "Successfully created file debug_test_13.txt"
- Matrix room created: !rEMLnxaQVtccJcudGw:matrix.oculair.ca
- Matrix room received: Initial "Task Execution Started" message only
- Matrix room DID NOT receive: Completion message

**Logs**:

**Status**: ✅ Code in place
**Result**: Better message formatting when it works

## Code Paths That Should Execute But Don't

### Path 1: Normal Completion (execute-task.ts lines 245-283)

```typescript
// Line 210: This call appears to hang
const result = await deps.execution.execute(executionRequest, (event) => {
  // Event handler
});

// Line 253: SHOULD execute but doesn't
console.error(`[execute-task] Task ${taskId} completed with status: ${finalStatus}`);

// Line 257: SHOULD execute but doesn't
console.error(`[execute-task] Checking Matrix room for task ${taskId}...`);

// Lines 273-277: SHOULD execute but doesn't
await deps.matrix.closeTaskRoom(
  roomInfo.roomId,
  taskId,
  summary
);
```

### Path 2: Matrix Room Closing (matrix-room-manager.ts lines 134-154)

```typescript
async closeTaskRoom(roomId: string, taskId: string, summary: string): Promise<void> {
  log(`Closing task room ${roomId} for task ${taskId}`);

  const summaryHtml = summary.replace(/\n/g, '<br>');
  
  await this.matrixClient.sendHtmlMessage(
    roomId,
    summary,
    `<h3>${summaryHtml.split('\n\n')[0]}</h3>
<p>${summaryHtml.split('\n\n').slice(1).join('<br><br>')}</p>
<p><em>This room will remain available for review.</em></p>`,
    {
      "io.letta.task": {
        task_id: taskId,
        event_type: "task_completed",
      },
    }
  );

  log(`Task room ${roomId} closed`);
}
```

**This method is never called** - We never see the "Closing task room" log.

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Event Type Mapping Not Working
**Theory**: The "finish" to "complete" event mapping isn't working correctly
**Test**: Check logs after latest deployment to see if completion logs appear
**Status**: Deployed in commit 76dfd19, awaiting test results

### Hypothesis 2: Execution Manager Deadlock
**Theory**: Even with event mapping, there's still a deadlock in the completion promise
**Evidence**: 
- OpenCode server shows `type=finish` events
- No completion logs appear
- Task completes (Letta receives notification somehow?)
**Status**: Needs investigation

### Hypothesis 3: Async Error Swallowing
**Theory**: executeTaskAsync throws an error that's caught and swallowed
**Evidence**: Line 106-108 in execute-task.ts has catch block
```typescript
executeTaskAsync(/* ... */).catch((error) => {
  console.error(`Task ${taskId} failed:`, error);
});
```
**Status**: No error logs seen, but this could hide issues

### Hypothesis 4: Multiple Execution Paths
**Theory**: Letta might be receiving completion through different mechanism (workspace block updates)
**Evidence**: 
- Letta gets notified
- Matrix doesn't get notified
- Suggests two different code paths
**Status**: Needs code review

### Deployment Info

- **Container**: letta-opencode-plugin
- **Image**: ghcr.io/oculairmedia/letta-opencode-plugin:latest
- **Latest Commit**: 76dfd19 (Map OpenCode finish events to complete events)
- **Build Status**: ✅ Success
- **Deployment**: ✅ Deployed

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Test Current Deployment**
   - Run test task with Meridian
   - Check if completion logs now appear
   - Verify Matrix room receives completion message

2. **Add More Logging**
   - Add logging at the START of deps.execution.execute() callback
   - Add logging in execution-manager.ts when "complete" event received
   - Add logging in matrix-client.ts when sending messages

3. **Verify Event Flow**
   - Confirm "finish" events are being converted to "complete"
   - Confirm "complete" events trigger `completed = true`
   - Confirm `completionPromise` resolves

### If Still Not Working

1. **Review Alternative Approaches**
   - Could send Matrix message immediately when task completes (bypassing closeTaskRoom)
   - Could use a different event type from OpenCode server
   - Could implement a heartbeat/polling mechanism

2. **Investigate OpenCode SDK**
   - Check if there's a different way to detect completion
   - Review OpenCode server event documentation
   - Consider using REST API instead of event stream

3. **Simplify Execution Path**
   - Remove complex Promise.race logic
   - Use simpler completion detection
   - Add timeout at higher level

## Timeline

- **2025-10-25 04:30**: Issue first identified
- **2025-10-25 04:45**: Discovered console.log vs console.error issue
- **2025-10-25 05:00**: Identified event type mismatch ("finish" vs "complete")
- **2025-10-25 05:20**: Applied event mapping fix
- **2025-10-25 05:37**: Deployed latest fix (commit 76dfd19)
- **2025-10-25 05:40**: Current status - awaiting test results

## Key Insights

1. **Logging is Critical**: The console.log vs console.error issue hid the real problem for a long time
2. **Event Type Contracts**: Mismatched event types between server and client caused deadlock
3. **Async Complexity**: The async execution with Promise.race and event handlers is error-prone
4. **Multiple Notification Paths**: Different mechanisms for Letta vs Matrix notifications suggests design issue
