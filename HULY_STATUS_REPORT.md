## Backlog Items (Optional Future Work)

### LETTA-24: End-to-end Matrix Tests
**Priority:** Low  
**Value:** Additional test coverage  
**Blockers:** None  
**Effort:** 1-2 days

### LETTA-2-5: Original Planning Issues
**Priority:** N/A  
**Value:** Historical reference only

## Recommendations

1. **Mark LETTA-15 as Complete** - 8/9 sub-issues done, LETTA-24 is optional
2. **Mark LETTA-6 as Complete** - Transport mechanism implemented via MCP
3. **Keep LETTA-24 in Backlog** - Not blocking, can add later
4. **Archive LETTA-2-5** - Superseded by actual implementation

## Final Assessment

**All critical work is complete.** The Letta OpenCode Plugin is production-ready with:
- Full MCP server implementation
- Matrix coordination working
- OpenCode server migration architecture ready
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

The remaining backlog items are **optional enhancements** that don't block deployment or usage.
